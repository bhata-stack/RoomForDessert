# About this Website
RoomForDessert is a place for me to share my joy of food and to practice
my HTML and CSS skills. I'm not interested in reviewing or critiquing
food, rather, I just like to share my thoughts. A simple meal can mean
a lot of things to a lot of different people, and I want to explore some
of the things it means to me.
